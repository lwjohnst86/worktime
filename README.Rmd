# worktime

The goal of worktime is to visualize time spent working. Can also import
clocking data from `.org` files.

# Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lwjohnst86/worktime")
```

# Usage

Have an `.org` file where you clock your time? Import it into R so you can do
data analysis on your hours!

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(worktime)
library(dplyr)
clocking <- import_org_clock("data-raw/clocking.org")
clocking
```

Check how much time you've spent on each task/heading.

```{r}
clocking %>% 
    add_minutes_worked() %>% 
    group_by(Header1) %>% 
    summarize(TotalHoursWorked = sum(as.numeric(MinutesWorked)) / 60)
```
